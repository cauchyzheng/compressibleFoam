Tutorials, Training and Documentation **(new)**
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The compressibleFoam source has been ported to all versions of OpenFOAM v1.7-2.3. The
first version of the code based on OpenFOAM v1.7 is released under the GNU/GPL license. 
Also note that this version is only first order accurate. The second order code and 
laminar version are used for my training programs. I earn my living using these codes
and hence have reserved the option of releasing them in open.

Maybe someday I might!

I am enclosing free sample slides for my workshop on "OpenFOAM beginner programming". Note 
that the slides are copyrighted and I will be more than happy to give you permission to use
them. But kindly drop me an email before you do so with the intent of using my slides. Usually
I am ok if you are using the slides for educational/research purpose. 

Instructional workshop on OpenFOAM programming
-----------------------------------------------

1) Module 1: Basics of OpenFOAM data-types and fields
:download:`part 1 <./pdfs/of_slides/week_1_day_1.pdf>`
:download:`part 2 <./pdfs/of_slides/week_1_day_2.pdf>`
:download:`part 3 <./pdfs/of_slides/week_1_day_3.pdf>`

2) Module 2: Operators, LUD Matrices and others 
:download:`part 1 <./pdfs/of_slides/week_2_day_1.pdf>`
:download:`part 2 <./pdfs/of_slides/week_2_day_2.pdf>`
:download:`part 3 <./pdfs/of_slides/week_2_day_3.pdf>`

3) Module 3: Random topics of interest : Limiters and Parallelization, compressibleFoam solver
:download:`part 1 <./pdfs/of_slides/week_3_day_1.pdf>`
:download:`part 2 <./pdfs/of_slides/week_3_day_2.pdf>`


Other course I offer,

Advanced OpenFOAM programming course
-------------------------------------
Same topics as in “Instructional workshop on OpenFOAM programming” course +

5) Basics of mesh motion

6) Lagrangian/Particle simulation in OF (programming aspects)

7) Random Topics: Looking beyond LDU Matrix and non-zero halos, parallelization of particle simulations, visualization and post-processing (programming), Second order compressibleFoam, Viscous terms

The above courses have been tailored to all versions of OpenFOAM > 1.7.x. In addition, I am open to new proposals for customized training courses.
