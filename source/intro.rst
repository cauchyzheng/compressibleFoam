Introduction
=============

The present work is born out of the series of lecture delivered to the scientists of the Computational and Theoretical Fluid Dynamics Division, NAL, on the usage of the OpenFOAM libraries to develop CFD solvers. This code has been further polished over the years from the many OpenFOAM programming workshops I have conducted across companies and academic institutions. This is primarily a teaching aid and I have decided to make this code open so that many more can get educated in OpenFOAM and its used for Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD).

I am grateful to the participants of my lectures and workshops, who have helped me to shape this code and point out bugs. This code has been run on variety of machines, operating systems, and compilers. More information on the solver can be obtained from the TOC available in the main page.
